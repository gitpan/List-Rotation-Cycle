Revision history for Perl extension List::Rotation::Cycle

1.003
        initial published revision

1.004
        * added more tests and META.yml
        * The API and methods are not changed. So there is no reason to upgrade from 1.003.

        This will be the last supported version of List::Rotation::Cycle
        (unless someone finds some bugs).
        I suggest you use List::Rotation instead.
        The Module List::Rotation also contains a package
        List::Rotation::Cycle     and some derivatives of it
        List::Rotation::Alternate and
        List::Rotation::Toggle
